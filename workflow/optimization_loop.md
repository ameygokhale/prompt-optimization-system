# Prompt Optimization Loop

1. Run initial prompt
2. Evaluate output using defined criteria
3. Collect structured feedback
4. Modify prompt based on feedback
5. Re-run and compare results
6. Repeat until output quality improves

This loop demonstrates systematic prompt improvement
rather than trial-and-error prompting.
